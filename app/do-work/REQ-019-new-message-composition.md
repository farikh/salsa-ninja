# Add new message composition — not just booking thread replies

## What

Currently users can only respond to messages within booking threads. There is no way to create a new message/conversation from scratch. Need a "New Message" button that allows composing a message to any user.

## Context

- The Messages card on the dashboard shows existing conversations
- "View all conversations" links to the conversations page
- There is no "New Message" or "Compose" button anywhere
- A booking creates a thread automatically, but standalone messaging is needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "New Message" button visible on messages/conversations page
- [ ] Can select a recipient from a list of users
- [ ] Can compose and send a message
- [ ] New conversation appears in the messages list
