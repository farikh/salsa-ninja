# User Request

## Verbatim Input

I'm still not happy with the private lesson/calendar/communication flow. Walk me through creating a PRD with mermaid illustrations to hand to do work.

Design unified-experience using docs/specs/unified-experience-prd.md — this is a 5-phase PRD covering unified schedule view, communication layer, booking flow redesign, instructor command center, and owner master schedule. Start with Phase A.

## Decisions (from PRD review)

1. Dashboard stays home — My Schedule is one tap away
2. DMs are student ↔ instructor only — expandable later
3. Inquiries auto-close at 72 hours
4. Enhanced instructor cards, no dedicated profile pages
5. Owner gets filterable master schedule

## Assets

- PRD: `docs/specs/unified-experience-prd.md`
