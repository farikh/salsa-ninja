# Phase D: Instructor Command Center

## What

Redesign the instructor dashboard into a single command center with today's timeline, pending requests, messages, mini availability grid, and quick stats.

## Context

- PRD: `docs/specs/unified-experience-prd.md` (Section 8)
- Dashboard stays as home page (decision from PRD review)
- Blocked by: Phase C (REQ-009)

## Requirements (from PRD)

- **US-16:** See full day (lessons + events) in one timeline
- **US-17:** Confirm/decline requests inline from dashboard
- **US-18:** See and respond to messages from dashboard
- **US-19:** Glance at weekly availability and quick-edit
- **US-20:** Badge counts for pending requests and unread messages
